# Change Data Capture (CDC)

## Debezium

Debezium is an open source distributed platform for change data capture.
Debezium is an open source project that provides a low latency data streaming platform for change data capture (CDC).
You set up and configure Debezium to monitor your databases, and then your applications consume events for each row-level change made to the database.

## Flink CDC

Flink CDC is a distributed data integration tool for real time data and batch data.
Its primary purpose is to enable the real-time ingestion of data changes from various databases into Flink, allowing for continuous processing and integration into downstream systems.
Apache Flink's Change Data Capture (CDC) connectors leverage the Debezium embedded engine to capture and stream real-time data changes from various databases directly into Flink pipelines.
