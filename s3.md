## AWS Storage Gateway

https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects your on-premises applications and IT infrastructure with Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage. It essentially provides a bridge, allowing your local applications to seamlessly use virtually unlimited cloud storage for things like backup, archiving, disaster recovery, and data processing.

The gateway is deployed as a virtual machine (VM) appliance (on VMware, Hyper-V, or Linux KVM) or as an Amazon EC2 instance in your environment. It uses standard storage protocols (like NFS, SMB, and iSCSI) to allow your existing applications to access AWS storage services like Amazon S3, Amazon S3 Glacier, and Amazon EBS without needing significant modification. It also includes local caching to provide low-latency access to frequently used data.

ZeroFS makes S3 storage feel like a real filesystem. It provides file-level access via NFS and 9P and block-level access via NBD. Fast enough to compile code on, with clients already built into your OS. No FUSE drivers, no kernel modules, just mount and go.
