## Model alloys

Model alloys are a technique for improving the performance of agentic AI systems by mixing different large language models within a single task loop. Instead of relying on one model to handle all reasoning steps, an alloy alternates between two or more models — for example, Anthropic’s Sonnet and Google’s Gemini — allowing each to contribute its unique strengths at different stages of problem solving. The models remain unaware that they are collaborating, creating a seamless fusion of perspectives that yields better results than any model alone. Model alloys are especially effective for complex, multi-step tasks that require diverse insights or creative leaps, such as vulnerability detection, research, or iterative reasoning, where combining different cognitive “styles” can lead to stronger, more consistent performance.
