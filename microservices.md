- Microservices are independently deployable services modeled around a business domain. 
- A microservice architecture is based on multiple collaborating microservices.
- Independent deployability is key.

## Independent deployability
Releasing changes to a single microservice into production without having to deploy anything else.

## Coupling
- Ensure that services are loosely coupled.
- Be able to change one service without having to change anything else.
- Explicit, well-defined, and stable contracts between services
- Loosely coupled with stable interfaces: guides establishing service boundaries.

## Domain modeling
Make changes inside of a single process boundary.

## Process

- Microservices: pain and suffering
- It's a dial, not a switch
- Turn it gradually, learn
- Run in production
- Improve feedback cycles
- Incremental changes without rearchitecting the whole thing
- Interleave incremental arch refactoring with shipping features to customers
